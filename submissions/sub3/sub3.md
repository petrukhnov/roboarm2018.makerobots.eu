# Cardboard arm

(email submission)

## Description

My robotic arm is made up of a Cardboard frame, popsicle sticks and plastic pinchers. It is controlled by Arduino Uno board. I used two servo motors to build it. Servo movement is controlled by two potentiometers. Cubes are made up of Lego blocks.

The program will read the value of potentiometer, scale it to use with servo, sets the servo position according to the scaled value and wait 15 ms to reach the position.

Servo 1 is connected to pin 9 of Arduino and the controlling potentiometer is connected to pin A0. 

Servo 2 is connected to pin 7 of Arduino and the controlling potentiometer is connected to pin A1. 

Arduino board is powered up using the USB port of the laptop.
