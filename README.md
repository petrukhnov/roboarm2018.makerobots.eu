## 2018 Robotics arm contest

The goal of 2018 robotic arm contest is to bring robotics closer to people with little or no experience. If you are already skilled in that field, feel free to join and compete with others. 

In this contest you will create simple robotic arm that will put decorations to christmas/new year tree.
