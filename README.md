# 2018 Robotics Arm Contest

<http://roboarm2018.makerobots.eu>

The goal of 2018 robotic arm contest is to make robotics accessible to people with little or no experience. If you are already skilled in that field, feel free to join and compete with others. 

In this contest, you will create simple robotic arm that will put decorations to Christmas/New Year's tree. 

Feel free to use lego, vex, fischertechnik, wooden planks, cardboard, tape, your old VHS player and whatever else you have laying around. You could program servo motors with Arduino, or just turn simpler DC motors on and off. 

The final round of competition will be held online on December 31st, 2018. Participants will stream online video of their creations.

## Want to help?

- Gift a robotic arm set to the child, and help him to build it. That could be a great Christmas present and pleasant activity.
- Spread the word around. Share that page to people who interested in robotics or want to try. Or just post to your social network.
- Draw few pictures with robotic arms. We don't have anyone who could draw well. 
- Add something to the prize pool. Digitally deliverable content related to robotics or diy would be best.
