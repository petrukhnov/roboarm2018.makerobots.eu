## 2018 Robotics Arm Contest

The goal of 2018 robotic arm contest is to make robotics accessible to people with little or no experience. If you are already skilled in that field, feel free to join and compete with others. 

In this contest, you will create simple robotic arm that will put decorations to Christmas/New Year's tree. 

Feel free to use Lego, vex, fischertechnik, wooden planks, cardboard, tape, your old VHS player and whatever else you have laying around. You could program servo motors with Arduino, or just turn simpler DC motors on and off. 

The final round of competition will be held online on December 31st, 2018. Participants will stream online video of their creations.

## Rules 

1. Robotic arm should have exactly **2 motors**. Servo, DC, piezo, pump and others are allowed. You could use any brand or shape, as long as its longest size is less than 1m.
2. The base for the robotic arm should be small enough to fit on A4 paper (297mm x 210mm).
3. Entries should be submitted before **2018-12-27 23:00 UTC**
4. Points will be awarded during qualification and live rounds.
5. Allowed cube sizes: each side is 10-20mm. E.g. lego 2x2 brick is suitable (16x16x11 mm).

### Scores

Points are awarded for great work. Penalties will be applied for not respecting others time and effort.

#### Live rounds

One live round could have most 9 participants.

Places are grouped by 5 second intervals from fastest. 

1st places: 90 points

2nd places: 80 points

.... (and so on)

E.g. if 5 participants completed tasks in (min:s.ms): 
 - 06:58.123
 - 07:01.222
 - 07:04.468
 - 07:05.956
 - 07:09.550
 
Then the first 2 will get 90 points, 3rd and 4th - 80points , and 5th - 70 points. 



##### During qualification

The first 10 valid submissions get a bonus of +3 points.

Extra points will be awarded for log10(likes) rounded down. E.g. 100 likes will give 2 extra points, while 1.000.000 will give 6 extra points.



### Penalties

Poor streaming video quality: -1 to -50 points.

Skipping a task: -20 points.

Partial placement mistakes: -1 to -3 points (e.g. cube 30% on the line).

Being late for pre-match validation: -3 points.

Invalid size for area or cubes: -1 to -20 points. 

Updating submission: -0 points. We encourage to improve your work. 

Roboarm base is too big: -1 to -20 points. Only mechanical part with motors is evaluated here, everything that connected with wires/pipes, could be as big a you want. Batteries, laptop, breadboard, water tank, etc doesn't have to be in the stream either.  


### Submissions

Submission deadline 2018-12-27 23:00 UTC

 
### Play area
