## Scores

### Live rounds

One live round could have most 9 participants.

Places are grouped by 5 second intervals from fastest. 

1st places: 90 points

2nd places: 80 points

.... (and so on)

E.g. if 5 participants completed tasks in (min:s.ms): 
 - 06:58.123
 - 07:01.222
 - 07:04.468
 - 07:05.956
 - 07:09.550
 
Then the first 2 will get 90 points, 3rd and 4th - 80points , and 5th - 70 points. 



#### During qualification

The first 10 valid submissions get a bonus of +3 points.

Extra points will be awarded for log10(likes) rounded down. E.g. 100 likes will give 2 extra points, while 1.000.000 will give 6 extra points.



## Penalties

Being late for pre-match validation: -3 points.

Invalid size for area or cubes: -1 to -20 points.
